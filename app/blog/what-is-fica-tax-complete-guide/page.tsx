            FICA tax is one of the most important payroll taxes that affects every working American. Understanding what FICA tax is, how it works, and what it pays for is crucial for financial planning and understanding your paycheck. This comprehensive guide will explain everything you need to know about FICA taxes.

          <h2>What is FICA Tax?</h2>
          <p>
            FICA stands for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. It's a federal payroll tax that funds two important social insurance programs: Social Security and Medicare. FICA taxes are automatically withheld from your paycheck by your employer and are split between you and your employer.
