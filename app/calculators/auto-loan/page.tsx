          <h2>Understanding Auto Loans</h2>
          <p>
            Auto loans are secured loans used to purchase vehicles. The vehicle serves as collateral, 
            which typically results in lower interest rates compared to unsecured personal loans.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Key Factors Affecting Auto Loan Rates</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Credit Score:</strong> Higher scores typically qualify for lower rates</li>
            <li><strong>Loan Term:</strong> Longer terms may have higher rates</li>
            <li><strong>Down Payment:</strong> Larger down payments can reduce rates</li>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Age:</strong> Newer vehicles often qualify for better rates</li>
            <li><strong>Lender Type:</strong> Credit unions, banks, and dealerships offer different rates</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Tips for Better Auto Loan Terms</h3>

          </ul>
